# Web scrapping - Mars

**In this project it was used web scrapping tools in Python (BeautifulSoup and Splinter) to collect data from two different websites: [Mars - News](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and [Mars - Weather](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)** 

## Mars_news

**On the Mars_news website I collect and store all the titles and the previews text in a dictionary**

## Mars_weather

**On the Mars_weather website it was extracting the table into Pandas and answered the questions:**

1. How many months exist on Mars?

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days' worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?

4. Which months have Mars's lowest and highest atmospheric pressure?

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
